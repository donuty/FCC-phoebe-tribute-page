          <p>Phoebe Waller-Bridge is an English writer, director, actress and producer best known for her role in the 2016 television show Fleabag. She made her acting debut in 2009 on the stage production of Roaring Trade in Soho Theatre, but since then she’s focused mainly on telly work - which also includes writing and producing the phenomenon that is 2018 series Killing Eve, as well as it's 2019 sequel.
          <p>Phoebe not only wrote Fleabag, but she also starred in it as the main character. The show was developed from a one-woman play that Phoebe had written and starred in at the 2013 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where she also won an award for the piece.
          <p>Due to the success of the series it was moved from BBC Three to BBC Two. By 2016 it was so popular that on-demand Amazon Video service picked it up and streamed it in the US, where it's also become hugely popular.</p>
          <p>Of the series, Phoebe told The Guardian in 2017, "Being proper and sweet and nice and pleasing is a nightmare. It’s exhausting. As women, we get the message about how to be a good girl – how to be a good, pretty girl – from such an early age. Then, at the same time, we’re told that well-behaved girls won’t change the world or ever make a splash.</p>
          <p>"So it’s sort of like, well, what the f--- am I supposed to be? I’m supposed to be a really polite revolutionary? It’s impossible."</p>
          <p>The show has won Phoebe a TV BAFTA for Best Female Comedy Performance as well as two Royal Television Society Awards - one for Breakthrough and one for Best Writing – Comedy.</p>
          <p>Phoebe said earlier in 2019 that the series two finale would be "the final curtain", saying, "I have thought about it and there isn't going to be one."</p>
          <p>Phoebe told the crowd at an Amazon event that she has a "fantasy of bringing Fleabag back when I’m 50," with Amazon boss Jennifer Salke saying she was desperate for Phoebe to make another series.</p>
          <p>She said, "Anything Phoebe wants to do, nothing would make us happier to bring another season of her show. Anything she wants to do. I’m forever the optimist."</p>
          <p>Speaking on the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Phoebe revealed that there was actually never even supposed to be a second series of the show, telling the audience, "I was very smug about not coming back because I thought I had a lot of artistic integrity. The first season had a proper ending in my mind and it was based on a play and it was adapted to the same ending.</p>
          <p>"Fleabag talks to the camera a lot in the first season and by the end she stops talking to the camera. I thought, 'Unless I can re-invent a reason for why she talks to the camera again, I can’t see how I can justify coming back'. Going back to the second season with the same persona even though [her family] know her dark secret seemed dishonest to the camera."</p>
